# Policy Brief: Hospital Discharges in Europe (2017â€“2021)

## Key Insights
- **Eastern Europe** reports the highest inpatient discharge rates (often >30,000 per 100k inhabitants), compared to **Western/Northern Europe** (<20,000 per 100k).
- **COVID-19** significantly disrupted hospital activity in 2020â€“2021, with sharp declines in some countries (e.g., Germany, Spain).
- Persisting **regional disparities** may reflect differences in:
  - Hospital bed capacity
  - Organization of care (outpatient vs. inpatient preference)
  - Data reporting standards

## Policy Implications
- **Health system capacity:** High discharge rates may signal greater reliance on inpatient care, which can strain resources.
- **Efficiency opportunities:** Countries with lower discharges might rely more on outpatient care, suggesting models to explore.
- **Resilience:** Pandemic shocks highlight the need for flexible hospital systems and better surge planning.

## Recommendations
1. Encourage benchmarking between countries to identify best practices.
2. Invest in **outpatient alternatives** to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations.
3. Strengthen **pandemic preparedness** in hospital planning.
